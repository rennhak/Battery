LaptopBattery
-------------

This small tiny program takes a battery file input from *nix systems and produces a nice visual
representation on the commandline. Often the users of laptops have some gimmicks in their status bar
or task bar showning them that, this is though for simple powerusers annoying who like totally plain
systems. Or maybe you just want the information in a nice format for your screen status line etc.

Requirements
